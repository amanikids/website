= Taps -- simple database import/export app

A simple database agnostic import/export app to transfer data to/from a remote database.

== Usage: Server

Here's how you start a taps server

  $ taps server postgres://localdbuser:localdbpass@localhost/dbname httpuser httppassword

You can also specify an encoding in the database url

  $ taps server mysql://localdbuser:localdbpass@localhost/dbname?encoding=latin1 httpuser httppassword

== Usage: Client

When you want to pull down a database from a taps server

  $ taps pull postgres://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname http://httpuser:httppassword@example.com:5000

or when you want to push a local database to a taps server

  $ taps push postgres://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname http://httpuser:httppassword@example.com:5000

== Known Issues

* Blob data may not transfer properly, I suspect that SQLite3 is modifying some native ruby objects.
* Foreign Keys get lost in the schema transfer
* Large tables (>1 million rows with a large number of columns) get slower as the offset gets larger. This is due to it being inefficient having large offset values in queries.
