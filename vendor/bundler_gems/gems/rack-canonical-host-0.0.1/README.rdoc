= Rack Canonical Host

Rack Canonical Host is a bit of Rack middleware that lets you define a single
host as the canonical host for your site, and redirect all other hostnames to
that canonical host.

In the simplest case, just specify the host name and any requests coming in
that aren't for the host example.com will be rewritten with the proper host.

    use Rack::CanonicalHost, 'example.com'

You could also define a constant in your environment-specific configuration
files to set up a canonical host redirect for only certain environments.

    CANONICAL_HOST = 'example.com'

Then, you can set up the middle are like this.

    use Rack::CanonicalHost, CANONICAL_HOST if defined?(CANONICAL_HOST)

Alternatively, you can pass a block whose return value will be used to set the
canonical host.

    use Rack::CanonicalHost do
      case ENV['RACK_ENV'].to_sym
        when :staging then 'example.com'
        when :production then 'staging.example.com'
      end
    end
