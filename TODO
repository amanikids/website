TODO update Share this Page with this feedback from Joe:
  1. The "Share This Page" button should be above the footer page
     break, maybe to the left or right of the text, or perhaps
     underneath the "Next Page" link?? But, where it is now, it's hard
     to find.
  2. The "From" and "To" text fields should be "Sender's Email Address"
     "Recipient's Email Address" respectively. And the Recipient's
     Email Address should be first.
  3. After you hit "Share this Page" and your email gets send, you get
     a Thanks message. Very cool, but can we make it say: "Thank you
     for helping us rescue more children from a life on the streets"?
