TODO Working on links now and for some reason they don't feel right. I don't know if it's the underlining or the black bold. Can we change to have the links not underlined, and go to the more natural blue for the link?
TODO One thing that I would like to add to your list is to move the "Share this Page" button. Valerie and I were thinking that it's a little distracting hovering directly beneath the text. Is there a way we could move it lower on the page without hiding it completely?
MAYBE Gallery images seem to be 1px too low
