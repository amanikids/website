MAYBE us js to show an "edit" link if you've got the cookie
MAYBE why does the facebox jump around from "loading" to "loaded"?
MAYBE admin screen could list pages that don't have any photos, that is, those that would show the "missing" photo.

TODO Working on links now and for some reason they don't feel right. I don't know if it's the underlining or the black bold. Can we change to have the links not underlined, and go to the more natural blue for the link?
