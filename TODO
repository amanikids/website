MAYBE why does the facebox jump around from "loading" to "loaded"?
MAYBE add a <link rel="edit" /> -- see http://universaleditbutton.org/Universal_Edit_Button

TODO Working on links now and for some reason they don't feel right. I don't know if it's the underlining or the black bold. Can we change to have the links not underlined, and go to the more natural blue for the link?
