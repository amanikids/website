  body: "Amani's _Upendo_ (Love) program was designed to ensure that every child in our care receives individual love and attention. The children meet regularly in groups of four with their Upendo group leader, one of the Amani caregivers. These small groups serve as family units. The children are encouraged to discuss their ideas, feelings, and concerns. They tell the caregiver if there are any problems with other children or if there's anything they need, like a new pair of shoes or a toothbrush.\n\nThe Upendo groups also have topical discussions on issues like honesty, working hard in school, and helping others - the kinds of lessons the children would be learning if they were with their parents. Upendo groups are one way that Amani ensures that each child in our care receives personal attention and love."

  body: "Because our goal is to develop responsible, self-reliant young adults, Amani is committed to providing an education for each child we work with. The Amani children are educated through a variety of programs.\n\nAmani supports children in local primary and secondary schools. Because of the often prohibitive expense of going to school as well as the many families who need their children to tend farms and livestock, only 54% of Tanzanian children complete primary school.  We sponsor the education of children who live at Amani as well as the children who we have reunited with families in the community.\n\nMany children rescued from a life on the streets have missed considerable amounts of time in their education. It isn’t an option to place them in classes with children their own age who have gone to school continuously. Amani’s Non-Formal Education Program provides children with a safe place to study and learn.  Our teachers have created a special fast-track curriculum that takes into consideration the unique needs of our kids.  Last year, the program was officially registered by the Tanzanian government, which means that our students are able to sit for the same secondary school entrance exams as children who attend state-run schools.\n\nFinally, Amani supports older children in vocational training programs. Children learn skills that will unlock opportunities for their futures. They may study carpentry, electrical repair, mechanics, or even traditional art and drumming!"

  body: "h3. Who started Amani and how?\n\nAmani Children’s Home was established on August 29, 2001 by local Tanzanians to meet the needs of the rapidly growing population of street children in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. They named the new home “Amani”, which means peace in Swahili. Life on the streets is terrifying and dangerous for children, and from the very beginning Amani has been a haven of peace for children who are homeless. Amani is proud to have been founded by locals and, to this day, almost all of the staff, leadership and Board are indigenous Tanzanians. We believe that the local community knows its own needs and the best ways to address them.\n\nh3. Why are there street children in Tanzania?\n\nThe root causes behind children fleeing to the streets are complex and multi-faceted and each child has their own individual story and background. However, almost all children go to the streets seeking escape from hunger, abuse or neglect. Other root causes include: HIV/AIDS, rising divorce rates, the lack of rights for women and children, the prohibitive cost of primary education, and the lack of a functioning government-run social welfare system. For some specific examples of reasons why children run to the streets, read the children’s \"individual stories\":/meet-the-kids.\n\nh3. How many kids live at Amani? How old are they? Are there both boys and girls?\n\nAs of this writing (June 2008), there are currently 86 children living at Amani, both boys and girls, who are between the ages of 5 and 16. In addition to the children living at Amani, we support 174 kids who used to be homeless who Amani’s social workers were able to reunify with relatives.\n\nh3. Is Amani affiliated with a religious denomination or organization?\n\nAmani is committed to nurturing the children’s spiritual growth. However, Amani is not affiliated with any denomination or particular religious organization. There are several different religious organizations who have chosen to support us, both financially and by teaching and interacting with the children.\n\nh3. How is Amani funded?\n\nAmani receives funding from three sources - foundations, businesses, and individuals - with the bulk of our funding coming from individuals. Every donor makes a difference.\n\nh3. How do I know I can trust Amani with my donations?\n\nAmani is dedicated to the sound management of our funds. Because of this, Amani is externally audited every year. Also, Amani is governed by an active external Board of Trustees - all of whom live in Moshi; none of whom receive any financial compensation for their role in Amani’s supervision. This is made up of men and women including: a Norwegian doctor, a Tanzanian social worker, and Indian priest, a British accountant, a Tanzanian management consultant, an Indian educations specialist and a Tanzanian human rights advocate. Learn more about \"governance at Amani\":/governance.\n\nh3. How can I help?\n\nThere are several ways you can help. First of all, join our \"Helping Hands\":/helping-hands sponsorship program. Helping Hands commit to give monthly to Amani and provide a reliable source of support for the Amani children. Then, consider where you can spread the word about Amani [link to fundraising page] - raising support from your business, church, or community gorup. You also may apply for membership with Friends of Amani in your home country. If you have skills that you feel would benefit the children and caregivers at Amani, consider applying for our \"volunteer program\":/volunteer."

  body: "Amani provides a safe and loving home, nutritious meals, and medical care to homeless children in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. Amani’s trained caregivers make sure that each child rescued from the streets is given love and attention as well as important life skills, restoring hope to their lives.\n\nThe children receive three healthy meals a day. A typical meal is rice and beans with a side of cooked spinach. Many children arrive at Amani malnourished from living on the streets. With good, nutritious food, they quickly become healthy and active.\n\nMedical care is an important service that Amani provides to the children. Amani has a full time nurse who cares for all the children’s medical needs, from bandaging scrapes and bruises to treating more serious illnesses like malaria, TB and HIV. She gives weekly health lessons to the children on topics such as personal hygiene, STDs and nutrition.\n\nThere’s a real family atmosphere at Amani, with the older children taking care of the younger ones. Amani caregivers have created a cheerful, happy place that warmly welcomes children who have faced many hardships in their lives."

  body: "Tanzania has an estimated HIV infection rate of 8%. That means it’s critical for every Tanzanian to know how the virus is spread and how to avoid becoming infected.  This is especially important for the Amani children and youth, many of whom have lost parents to HIV/AIDS.  Amani addresses this important issue with our kids through:\n\n*Education*: Amani’s nurse teaches weekly health classes, where she dispels common myths about HIV and equips the students with facts.  Health class also includes discussions about other important topics, such as hygiene, nutrition, and dental care. In addition, each month volunteer HIV/AIDS teachers come to Amani to give lessons, using creative methods to help the children understand and remember.\n\n*Testing and Counseling*:  As we discuss these issues openly in class, the nurse encourages children to be tested and emphasizes how important it is to know your HIV status.  When children voluntarily choose to be tested, she and another caregiver accompany them to the testing place, where the child also receives counseling.\n\n*Treatment*: If a child tests HIV+, Amani is committed to helping them live healthy, strong lives full of the same opportunities that every other child at Amani gets.  They receive antibiotics and/or antiretroviral medicine depending on their health condition. Amani has a strict policy of confidentiality concerning those children living with HIV/AIDS."

  body: "The children at Amani have been rescued from life on the streets. While each of the children have their own unique stories of the hardships that drove them to the streets, the life of every homeless child in Tanzania is full of fear, hunger, and danger.\n\nAmani’s Street Educators go to the streets of Moshi town and nearby Arusha five nights a week to meet with the children who spend their nights sleeping in drainage ditches and back alleys.  Because many of the children have been physically and sexually abused, they are cautious about trusting adults.  Our Street Educators take time to build a friendship with the children, telling them that there is a safe place where they will be fed and protected, given clothing, an education and love. The children make a decision for themselves to accept the offer of rescue and to come to Amani.\n\nEach week, Amani’s nurse goes to the streets and offers medical care to the children living there.  She also gives health lessons on a variety of topics.  For many of the children, this is the first time they’ve ever seen a trained medical caregiver.

  title: Reuniting Families

  body: "Amani is not an orphanage. We believe that the best place for a child to grow up is in a safe and loving family and not in an institution.  We therefore aim to reunify children into the homes of extended family members, giving kids the chance to spend the rest of their childhood with an aunt, uncle, or grandparent. Locating family members is often a challenging task in Tanzania, where roads are unmapped and unnamed, and only a small minority of the population has access to a telephone or even electricity.\n\nAmani’s social workers travel all over the country, searching for children’s family members. Because extended family bonds are strong in Tanzania, many families are willing to care for young relatives in need. If a child’s relative is able to provide a safe and loving home for that  child, but cannot afford to feed and educate them, Amani will assist the family with the child’s food and education expenses to make it possible for the child to live with them.\n\nTo date, Amani has brought 280 formerly homeless children into the care of loving families.
